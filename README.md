# NeutrinoEchos
to accompany Gullin et al. 2021

In the scripts directory we provide jupyter notebooks that recreate
all the figures in the paper.  Any necessary data is linked from the
data directory, its compressed size is 1GB so we store it on zenodo at
doi 10.5281/zenodo.5701464, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5701464

To run some of the scripts you need SNEWPY
(https://github.com/SNEWS2/snewpy) and SNOwGLoBES
(https://github.com/SNOwGLoBES/snowglobes) installed, although we
provide the output of these cells in .npy files so this is not
necessary to reproduce the figures.
